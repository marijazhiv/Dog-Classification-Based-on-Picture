## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to use a convolutional neural network for image classification. Images are divided into training and testing sets, with the model being trained on the training set and tested on the testing set.

## Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow`

You can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
Replace yourusername and repository-name with your details.

Download images: Place dog images in the images/ directory. The image names should follow the format <class>_<number>.jpg, for example, labrador_01.jpg.

Run the script: In your terminal, run the script:

bash
Copy code
python your_script_name.py
Usage
Train the model: If the model does not exist, the script will train it using the data in the images/ directory. The model will be saved as dog_classifier_model.h5.

Prediction: After training, you can classify new images using the following code:

python
Copy code
image_path = input("Enter the path to the image: ")
img = load_img(image_path, target_size=(150, 150))
img_array = img_to_array(img)
img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
img_array /= 255.0

predictions = model.predict(img_array)
predicted_class = np.argmax(predictions[0])
Results: The prediction results will be printed in the console.

## Data Structure
images/: Directory containing dog images. Each image should be named as <class>_<number>.jpg.
dog_classifier_model.h5: The saved model after training.
