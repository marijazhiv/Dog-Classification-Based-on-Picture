## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to use a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification. Images are divided into training and testing sets, with the model being trained on the training set and tested on the testing set.

## Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow`

## Installation
1. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow
